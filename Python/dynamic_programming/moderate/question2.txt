Source: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/0-1-knapsack-problem-dp-10/

Given weights and values of n items, put these items in a knapsack of capacity W to get the maximum total value in the knapsack. Each item can be included or excluded only once.

Example 1:
Input: W = 50, wt = [10, 20, 30], val = [60, 100, 120], n = 3
Output: 220

Example 2:
Input: W = 10, wt = [5, 4, 6, 3], val = [10, 40, 30, 50], n = 4
Output: 90
