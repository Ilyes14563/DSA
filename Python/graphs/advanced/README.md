# Graphs â€“ Advanced Level

This folder contains advanced-level graph interview questions and clean Python solutions, sourced from real interviews (mainly GeeksforGeeks). Each problem includes the original link, sample input/output, and a well-documented answer.

## Questions Included
1. **Strongly Connected Components (Kosaraju's Algorithm)**  
   [GeeksforGeeks Problem](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/strongly-connected-components/)
2. **Minimum Spanning Tree (Kruskal's Algorithm)**  
   [GeeksforGeeks Problem](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/kruskals-minimum-spanning-tree-algorithm/)
3. **Articulation Points (Cut Vertices)**  
   [GeeksforGeeks Problem](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/articulation-points-or-cut-vertices-in-a-graph/)

## Usage
- Read each `questionX.txt` for the problem statement and sample input/output.
- Review the corresponding `answerX.py` for a clean, professional Python solution.
- Use these as a reference for interviews or DSA practice.
