Articulation Points (Cut Vertices)
Source: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/articulation-points-or-cut-vertices-in-a-graph/

Given an undirected graph with V vertices and adjacency list adj, find all articulation points (cut vertices) in the graph. Return the list of articulation points in sorted order.

Example 1:
Input: V = 5, adj = [[1,2], [0,2], [0,1,3,4], [2,4], [2,3]]
Output: [2, 3, 4]

Example 2:
Input: V = 4, adj = [[1], [0,2], [1,3], [2]]
Output: [1, 2]
