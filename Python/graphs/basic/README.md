This folder contains basic-level graph interview questions and clean Python solutions, sourced from real interviews (mainly GeeksforGeeks). Each problem includes the original link, sample input/output, and a well-documented answer.

## Questions Included
1. **Breadth First Search (BFS) of Graph**  
   [GeeksforGeeks Problem](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/breadth-first-traversal-for-a-graph/)
2. **Depth First Search (DFS) of Graph**  
   [GeeksforGeeks Problem](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/depth-first-traversal-for-a-graph/)
3. **Detect Cycle in an Undirected Graph**  
   [GeeksforGeeks Problem](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/detect-cycle-in-an-undirected-graph/)

## Usage
- Read each `questionX.txt` for the problem statement and sample input/output.
- Review the corresponding `answerX.py` for a clean, professional Python solution.
- Use these as a reference for interviews or DSA practice.
