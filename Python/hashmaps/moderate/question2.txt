Source: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-first-repeating-element-array-integers/

Given an array of integers, find the first repeating element in it (the element that occurs more than once and whose index of first occurrence is smallest). If no repeating element exists, return -1.

Example 1:
Input: arr = [10, 5, 3, 4, 3, 5, 6]
Output: 5

Example 2:
Input: arr = [6, 10, 5, 4, 9, 120]
Output: -1
